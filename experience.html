            During this internship, I had the opportunity to undertake various pentesting projects for both mobile and web applications. During the process, I was able to 
            discover various vulnerabilities such as Indirect Object References and SQL Injection. 
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, I also worked with the developers and project managers of the affected applications to fix and verify the reported vulnerabilities.

            During this internship, I created an automated bot which is capable of simulating an attacker during a cyber defense exercise. The bot is also capable of generating
            several unrelated user actions to avoid detection during the cyber defense exercise.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, I also learnt to deploy the bot in Docker for easy scalability.

            For this role, I supervised 5 teams of freshmen in their suummer software engineering project. During this period of time, my main responsibilities were to ensure
            that the students are able to meet their tight dealines and produce the expected results.
          </p>
          <p>
            On top of that, I clarified their doubts and concerns over the period of 3 months
