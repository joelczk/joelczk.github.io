            During this internship, I had the opportunity to undertake various pentesting projects for both mobile and web applications. During the process, I was able to 
            discover various vulnerabilities such as Indirect Object References and SQL Injection. On top of that, I also worked with the developers and project managers
            of the affected applications to fix and verify the reported vulnerabilities.
